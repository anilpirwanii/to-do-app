## Tech Stack
### **Frontend**
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Type-safe JavaScript for enhanced development experience.

### **Backend**
- **[Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)**: NoSQL database for storing user tasks.
- **[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)**: Secure and scalable authentication system.

### **Deployment**
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Hosting platform for deploying the app.

## How It Works
1. **Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely. Each user's tasks are stored in Firebase Firestore.
2. **Task Management**:
   - Tasks are added with a fade-in animation for better visual feedback.
   - Tasks can be toggled as completed or deleted permanently.
3. **Real-Time Data**: Task updates are reflected instantly, thanks to Firebaseâ€™s real-time capabilities.

## Development Process
### **1. Planning**
- Decided on the core features: authentication, task management, and a clean UI.
- Chose Firebase for backend services to simplify setup and focus on front-end development.

### **2. Implementation**
- **Frontend**: Used Next.js for building a responsive, component-driven UI.
- **Backend**: Configured Firebase Firestore and Authentication for storing user-specific tasks.
- **Styling**: Designed the interface using Tailwind CSS, focusing on minimalism and modern aesthetics.

### **3. Testing**
- Tested the app locally using the development and production builds.
- Validated task operations and authentication flows across different devices and screen sizes.

### **4. Deployment**
- Deployed the app on Vercel, ensuring a live, production-ready version.

## Future Improvements
- Add due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Enable drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
- Include a progress tracker for task completion.
- Implement dark mode for better accessibility.
